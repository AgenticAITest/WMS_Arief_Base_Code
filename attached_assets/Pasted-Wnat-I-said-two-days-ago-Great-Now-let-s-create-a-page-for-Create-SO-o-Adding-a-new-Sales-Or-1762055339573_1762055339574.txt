Wnat I said two days ago:
Great!! Now let's create a page for Create SO.

o Adding a new Sales Order, will ask for the following:
 Customer: a drop down from supplier table
 Items of purchase: a list of all master item: SKU, name, available stock, a warning icon is shown when available stock <= minimum stock quantity, a text box for the user to enter the quantity of sales, sales price, and calculated total for that record
 A running total at the bottom of the list is also calculated based on the total of each item selected to be sold.
 Users cannot enter value greater than available stock for each item.
 The items listing to be sold is a multipage listing with maximum of 20 items shown at one time. Consequently, a search field based on name and sku should be avaialable for faster searching.
o A Create Sales Order button will provide a confirmation modal, with generated SO number (look at document_number_config for format), customer name and address, list of items with the quantity and subtotal, and a total purchase value at the bottom. A cancel button should be provided in the modal.
o Confirming the creation of a PO in the modal will create a record in the database (sales order), set the status to complete, and the next step in the flow is properly setup

Give me your plan. Make sure the UI is consistent with create PO in terms of layout, width and height of modals, etc.

Then you created a plan: 
Planned sales order page components (5 seconds)
📋 Plan for Sales Order Create Page
Perfect! I'll create a comprehensive Sales Order Create page matching the Purchase Order design. Let me outline the approach:

🎯 Architecture Overview
The page will follow the same pattern as Purchase Order Create, consisting of:

Main Page Component (SalesOrderCreate.tsx) - List view + orchestration
Create SO Modal (CreateSOModal.tsx) - Form for creating new sales orders
SO Confirmation Modal (SOConfirmationModal.tsx) - Preview before creation
SO Print View (SOPrintView.tsx) - Post-creation view
📐 Component Structure
1. SalesOrderCreate.tsx (Main Page)
Top Section: "Create New Sales Order" button (primary action)
Table Section: List of incomplete sales orders (status ≠ 'completed')
Table Columns: SO Number, Customer, Order Date, Total Amount, Status, Actions
Actions: View 👁️, Edit ✏️, Delete 🗑️
Loading States: Skeleton loaders matching PO design
2. CreateSOModal.tsx (Form Modal)
Modal Size: Match PO modal dimensions (likely max-w-6xl)

Form Sections:

A. Customer Information
Customer Dropdown: Fetches from customers table (Note: You mentioned "supplier table" but I'll use customer table based on schema)
Customer Location Dropdown: Auto-populated based on selected customer
Warehouse Dropdown: Destination warehouse

B. Order Details
Order Date (date picker, default: today)
Requested Delivery Date (optional)
Notes (textarea)

C. Items Selection Table
Search Bar: Filter by SKU or Name (debounced search)
Pagination: 20 items per page
Table Columns:
SKU - Product SKU
Name - Product name
Available Stock - Current inventory level with warning icon (⚠️) when stock ≤ minimum quantity
Quantity - Input field (validates: cannot exceed available stock)
Unit Price - Sales price input
Total - Auto-calculated (quantity × unit price)
Action - Add/Remove button
D. Running Total Section

Subtotal: Sum of all item totals
Grand Total: Bottom-right, prominent display
Item Count: "X items selected"
Validation Rules:

✅ Customer required

Proceed to Confirm - Opens confirmation modal

3. SOConfirmationModal.tsx (Preview Modal)
Modal Size: Same as PO confirmation modal

Content Sections:
Header: "Confirm Sales Order Creation"
Generated SO Number: Display auto-generated number
Customer Information:
Customer Name
Customer Address (from customer location)
